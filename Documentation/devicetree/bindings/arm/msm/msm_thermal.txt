MSM thermal driver (MSM_THERMAL)

MSM_THERMAL is a kernel platform driver which regulates thermal conditions
on the device during kernel boot. The goal of MSM_THERMAL is to prevent the
temperature of the system from exceeding a thermal limit at which it cannot
operate. Examples are CPU junction thermal limit, or POP memory thermal limit.
The MSM_THERMAL driver polls the TSENS sensor hardware during boot, and
reduces the maximum CPU frequency allowed in steps, to limit power/thermal
output when a threshold temperature is crossed. It restores the maximum CPU
frequency allowed in the same stepwise fashion when the threshold temperature
(with hysteresis gap) is cleared.

The devicetree representation of the MSM_THERMAL block should be:

Required properties

- compatible: "qcom,msm-thermal"
- qcom,sensor-id: The id of the TSENS sensor polled for temperature.
			Typically the sensor closest to CPU0.
- qcom,poll-ms: Sampling interval to read sensor, in ms.
- qcom,limit-temp: Threshold temperature to start stepping CPU down, in degC.
- qcom,temp-hysteresis: Degrees below threshold temperature to step CPU up.
- qcom,freq-step: Number of frequency steps to take on each CPU mitigation.
- qcom,core-limit-temp: Threshold temperature to start shutting down cores
			in degC
- qcom,core-temp-hysterisis: Degrees below core-limit-temp, the cores will be
			brought online in sequence.
- qcom,core-control-mask: The cpu mask that will be used to determine if a
			core can be controlled or not. A mask of 0 indicates
			the feature is disabled.
- qcom,vdd-restriction-temp: When temperature is below this threshold, will
			enable vdd restriction which will set higher voltage on
			key voltage rails, in degC.
- qcom,vdd-restriction-temp-hysteresis: When temperature is above this threshold
			will disable vdd restriction on key rails, in degC.
- <consumer_supply_name>-supply = <&phandle_of_regulator>: consumer_supply_name
			is the name that's defined in thermal driver.
			phandle_of_regulator is defined by reuglator device tree.

Optional child nodes
- qcom,<vdd restriction child node name>: Define the name of the child node.
			If this property exisits, qcom,vdd-rstr-reg, qcom,levels,
			qcom,min-level and qcom,freq-req need to exist, otherwise
			we return an error.
- qcom,vdd-rstr-reg: Name of the rail
- qcom,levels: Array of the level values. Unit is corner voltage for voltage request
			or kHz for frequency request.
- qcom,min-level: Request this level as minimum level when disabling voltage
			restriction. Unit is corner voltage for voltage request
			or kHz for frequency request.
- qcom,freq-req: Flag to determine if we should restrict frequency on this rail
			instead of voltage.

Example:

	qcom,msm-thermal {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-thermal";
		qcom,sensor-id = <0>;
		qcom,poll-ms = <250>;
		qcom,limit-temp = <60>;
		qcom,temp-hysteresis = <10>;
		qcom,freq-step = <2>;
		qcom,core-limit-temp = <90>;
		qcom,core-temp-hysterisis = <10>;
		qcom,core-control-mask = <7>;
		qcom,vdd-restriction-temp = <5>;
		qcom,vdd-restriction-temp-hysteresis = <10>;
		vdd_dig-supply=<&pm8841_s2_floor_corner>

		qcom,vdd-dig-rstr{
			qcom,vdd-rstr-reg = "vdd_dig";
			qcom,levels = <5 7 7>; /* Nominal, Super Turbo, Super Turbo */
			qcom,min-level = <1>; /* No Request */
		};
	};
